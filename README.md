In this program, users/customers will be able to book an appointment at a hair salon from 9am to 16pm. 
Once valid inputs are made through option 1, such as; day of the week, time, phone number, name,
a spot will be reserved for the customer.
Customers are able to verify their own appointment by inputting a name, and the program checks for appointments under that name.
If no appointments are made, a table is printed and states that no appointements are booked for the name.
If another customer decides to book an appointment that would conflict with an exisiting customer, an error message notifying the customer will show up, and will redirect them back to the main interface.
in the instance that a customer would like to cancel their appointment, they must select the option of cancel and provide day and time.
If the customer was currently registered, it will cancel, otherwise the program will notify the customer that the appointment does not exist.
As the list of appointments are made, users are able to view the day and week schedule for the salon, ensuring an organized view of future customer bookings.
Lastly, the admin is able to view total costs for the salon, determining the potential amount of money generated by customers.
